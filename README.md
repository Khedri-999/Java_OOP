# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java 🎯

These are some of my essays and practice projects from my OOP course at **ESTIN University**, where I explore Java's object-oriented programming concepts in depth.

## 📚 Core OOP Concepts (Definitions)

### 1. **Class**
A blueprint/template for creating objects. Defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods).

### 2. **Object**
An instance of a class that holds its own state (data) and behavior.

### 3. **Encapsulation** 🧊
Bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to some components.  
✔️ Uses `private` fields + `public` getters/setters  
✔️ Protects data integrity  

### 4. **Inheritance** 🧬  
Mechanism where a new class (child/subclass) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent/superclass).  
✔️ Uses `extends` keyword  
✔️ Promotes **code reuse**  

### 5. **Polymorphism** 🎭  
Ability of an object to take many forms.  
✔️ **Method Overriding**: Same method name, different implementation in child class  
✔️ **Method Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters  

### 6. **Abstraction** ✨  
Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.  
✔️ Achieved via `abstract` classes and `interfaces`  


🏫 Why I Learned OOP at ESTIN

    To build modular, maintainable software

    Understand real-world problem modeling

    Master Java for backend development

    Prepare for advanced topics (Design Patterns, SOLID principles)
